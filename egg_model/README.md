 
# The egg model data
 
 The Egg model  is a synthetic reservoir model developed by [J. D. Jansen et al., 2013](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/gdj3.21). We used the Egg model in the Computational Geosciences group at SINTEF Digital as a test case for developing data-driven models and testing new calibration methods for history matching.
